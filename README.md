# Solutions to Review Questions/Programming Exercises for C Primer Plus (6th Edition) by Stephen Prata

This repository contains my solutions to the Programming Exercises in _C
Primer Plus (6th Edition)_ by Stephen Prata. I committed to completing all of
the exercises as I learned C, and figure they are worth sharing here in case
they are useful to some.

Solutions for each chapter will only make use of topics introduced up to that 
point in the book. Therefore, these solutions may not be the most efficient or 
elegant, but will hopefully be of use to fellow readers who are learning C with
this book.
