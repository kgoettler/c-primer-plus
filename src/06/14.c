/*
 * Write a program that creates two eight-element arrays of doubles and uses a
 * loop to let the user enter values for the eight elements of the first array.
 * Have the program set the elements of the second array to the cumulative
 * totals of the elements of the first array. For example, the fourth element of
 * the second array should equal the sum of the first four elements of the first
 * array, and the fifth element of the second array should equal the sum of the
 * first five elements of the first array. (Itâ€™s possible to do this with nested
 * loops, but by using the fact that the fifth element of the second array
 * equals the fourth element of the second array plus the fifth element of the
 * first array, you can avoid nesting and just use a single loop for this task.)
 * Finally, use loops to display the contents of the two arrays, with the first
 * array displayed on one line and with each element of the second array
 * displayed below the corresponding element of the first array.
