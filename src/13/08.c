/*
 * Write a program that takes as command-line arguments a character and zero or
 * more filenames. If no arguments follow the character, have the program read
 * the standard input. Otherwise, have it open each file in turn and report how
 * many times the character appears in each file. The filename and the character
 * itself should be reported along with the count. Include error-checking to see
 * whether the number of arguments is correct and whether the files can be
 * opened. If a file canâ€™t be opened, have the program report that fact and go
 * on to the next file.
