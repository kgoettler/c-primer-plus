/*
 * Write a program that requests the hours worked in a week and then prints the
 * gross pay, the taxes, and the net pay. Assume the following:
 *
 * a. Basic pay rate = $10.00/hr
 * b.  Overtime (in excess of 40 hours) = time and a half 
 * c. Tax rate: #15% of the first $300
 * 20% of the next $150
 * 25% of the rest
 * 
 * Use #define constants, and donâ€™t worry if the example does not conform to
 * current tax law.
