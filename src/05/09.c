/*
 * Write a program that requests the user to enter a Fahrenheit temperature. The
 * program should read the temperature as a type double number and pass it as an
 * argument to a user-supplied function called Temperatures(). This function
 * should calculate the Celsius equivalent and the Kelvin equivalent and display
 * all three temperatures with a precision of two places to the right of the
 * decimal. It should identify each value with the temperature scale it
 * represents. Here is the formula for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius: 
 *
 * Celsius = 5.0 / 9.0 * (Fahrenheit - 32.0) 
 *
 * The Kelvin scale, commonly used in science, is a scale in which 0 represents
 * absolute zero, the lower limit to possible temperatures. Here is the formula
 * for converting Celsius to 
 *
 * Kelvin: Kelvin = Celsius + 273.16 
 *
 * The Temperatures() function should use const to create symbolic
 * representations of the three constants that appear in the conversions. The
 * main() function should use a loop to allow the user to enter temperatures
 * repeatedly, stopping when a q or other nonnumeric value is entered. Use the
 * fact that scanf() returns the number of items read, so it will return 1 if it
 * reads a number, but it wonâ€™t return 1 if the user enters q. The == operator
 * tests for equality, so you can use it to compare the return value of scanf()
 * with 1.
