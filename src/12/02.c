/*
 * Gasoline consumption commonly is computed in miles per gallon in the U.S. and
 * in liters per 100 kilometers in Europe. What follows is part of a program
 * that asks the user to choose a mode (metric or U.S.) and then gathers data
 * and computes fuel consumption:
 * Here is some sample output:
 *  Enter 0 for metric mode, 1 for US mode: 0 
 *  Enter distance traveled in kilometers: 600 
 *  Enter fuel consumed in liters: 78.8
 *  Fuel consumption is 13.13 liters per 100 km.  
 *  Enter 0 for metric mode, 1 for US mode (-1 to quit):  1
 *  Enter distance traveled in miles: 434 
 *  Enter fuel consumed in gallons: 12.7 
 *  Fuel consumption is 34.2 miles per gallon. 
 *  Enter 0 for metric mode, 1 for US mode (-1 to quit): 3
 *  Invalid mode specified. Mode 1(US) used. 
 *  Enter distance traveled in miles: 388 
 *  Enter fuel consumed in gallons: 15.3 
 *  Fuel consumption is 25.4 miles per gallon. 
 *  Enter 0 for metric mode, 1 for US mode (-1 to quit): -1
 *  Done. 
 *
 * If the user enters an incorrect mode, the program comments on that and uses
 * the most recent mode. Supply a pe12-2a.h header file and a pe12-2a.c source
 * code file to make this work. The source code file should define three
 * file-scope, internal-linkage variables. One represents the mode, one
 * represents the distance, and one represents the fuel consumed. The get_info()
 * function prompts for data according to the mode setting and stores the
 * responses in the file-scope variables. The show_info() function calculates
 * and displays the fuel consumption based on the mode setting. You can assume
 * the user responds with numeric input.
